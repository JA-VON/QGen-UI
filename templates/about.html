            Have you ever wanted a large bank of questions to choose from when building assessments for your students?
QGen will help you build it
<br />

What is QGen?
<br />
<br />

QGen is a question generator which produces questions in a variety of formats based on your specifications.

QGen allows you to specify a template for how you want a question to look, specify some parameters, define how these parameters should behave and then ask QGen to generate as much
            questions as you need! QGen will then give its best effort to give you that amount of unique questions. See the <a href="https://github.com/JA-VON/QGenPY/wiki/Getting-started">wiki</a> for
            a brief explanation of how the questions are generated.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>About the demo</strong>
<br />
<br />
            For a simple walkthrough of the demo you should enter the following:
            <br />
            title: Addition(You can name it whatever you'd like)
            <br />
            Number of Questions: Let's go with 20
            <br />
            Imports: Let's not import anything for this simple walkthrough
            <br />
            Type: Multiple Choice
            <br />
            Variables:
            <br />
            Click the Add button on the right hand side under add variable to add a variable.
            <br />
            name your variable num1 for this example.
            <br />
            Generator name: Let's use the randint generator that generates random integers
            <br />
            randint takes 2 parameters start and end. Go ahead and set those parameters and their values to 1 and 50 respectively.
            <br />
            Repeat the process for a second variable num2, but this time set the parameters for the generator to 50 and 100 respectively.
            <br />
            Note you can tinker with these values however you'd please.
            <br />
            Now that we have our variables let's build our question. In the body let's put the following:
            <br />
            What is {num1} + {num2}?
            <br />
            This just means every question will resemble that text, so an example of how an exact question could be is - "What is 2 + 54?" or "What is 51 + 12?".
            Note the second one shouldn't occur in this example based on how we set our generators. num1 should be between 1 and 50 and num2 should be between 50 and 100.
            <br />
            Now lets set some answers:
            <br />
            A wrong answer could be the difference of the two whereas we need the sum. So go ahead and put the following in one of the answer fields
            <br />
            ${num1} - {num2}$
            <br />
            Note it is enclosed in '$'. Anything enclosed in these characters will be executed in the Python runtime.
            Quick note is that you'd want to call any functions you imported to do any cool python stuff with the answers to throw students off
            <br />
            Seeing as this isn't the correct answer we won't check the correct checkbox
            <br />
            Let's go ahead and add the correct answer of ${num1} + {num2}$ in another text field and mark this as correct using the checkbox.
            <br />
            Go ahead and click build and you'll have a generated XML file you can upload right into moodle to import a ton of questions into your question bank.
            <br />
            For more complex examples please take a look at the wiki link above for now as I work on finding time to put more examples on the site.
            <br />
            Thanks for demoing.
